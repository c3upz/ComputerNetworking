File description: This file has the answers to the questions in the lab document



Step1: 
    Lab2_ST.c

Step2:

    netstat: this command shows details about the computers network connections. It lists all
    active TCP connections with the computer. It also shows IP addresses for the localhost and the IP
    address for the other network device involved in the TCP connection

    
    ifconfig: used to configure or view the configuration of a network interface

    hostname: returns the name of the local end-system / host

    ping: is used to help check if there are errors delivering packets to a specified network device

    traceroute: is a diagonstic tool that sends a packet to a foriegn end-system and keeps track of the time 
    it takes for the packet to travel from network device to network device. (eg. router to router)

    telnet: is a terminal emulation that allows users to connect to a remote device/host/end-system. This is 
    often used to manage website files remotely

    host/dig: this command performs a network DNS lookup

    route: a tool that allows users to manage their computers OS routing table

    arp: also know as 'Address Resolution Protocol' and its job is to map IP addresses to MAC addresses

Step3: 

    USA: washington.edu
    EU: canterbury.ac.nz
    Asia: www.useoul.edu

    A/B.

    Ping w/ 32 bytes
    washington.edu = 0.0% packet loss, RTT round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 29.865/32.127/40.532/2.888 ms; 
    canterbury.ac.nz = 0% packet loss, RTT min/avg/max/stddev = 160.069/161.257/162.447/0.662 ms;
    www.useoul.edu = 100% packet loss, the ping returned "Request timeout for icmp_seq #;

    Ping w/ 1048 bytes
    washington.edu = 0% loss, RTT min/avg/max/stddev = 31.591/35.412/45.230/4.319 ms; 
    canterbury.ac.nz = 0% packet loss, RTT min/avg/max/stddev = 161.331/162.622/164.518/0.931 ms;
    www.useoul.edu = 100% packet loss, the ping returned "Request timeout for icmp_seq #"; 

    C.
    The difference in the results for washington.edu and canterbury.ac.nz make sense as they are not close together. 
    Washington.edu had the lowest times as we are geographically closest to them. I do not know the hosts from asia do not let me ping them.
    I have tried pinging multiple asian hosts and the same thing occured.


Step4: 
    Lab2_2ST.c

Step5: 

    A. It says my computer is attempting to connect to the ip address 128.119.245.12, then it says that is is connected to 'gaia.cs.umass.edu'.
    It also provides us with an escape character. After a little while it says "connection closed by foreign host.

    B. When I execute the GET request it looks like the index.html page is returned. I just see a bunch of HTML tags

    C. I think file is named index.php as that is the last item in the path we entered. The title of the page is 'Computer Network Research Group'. The client is running HTTP version 1.1


Step6: 

    A. Since my the host in asia has given me troubles I will be doing this with my USA host (washington.edu) and my EU host(canterbury.ac.nz)

        washington.edu: 
        
        after entering "telnet washington.edu 80"

        Trying 128.95.155.134...
        Connected to washington.edu.
        Escape character is '^]'.
        HTTP/1.0 408 Request Time-out
        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Connection: close
        Content-Type: text/html

        <html><body><h1>408 Request Time-out</h1>
        Your browser didn't send a complete request in time.
        </body></html>
        Connection closed by foreign host.



        after entering "telnet washington.edu 3389"
        
        Trying 128.95.155.197...

        No response output in terminal



        canterbury.ac.nz:

        Trying 132.181.106.1...
        Connected to canterbury.ac.nz.
        Escape character is '^]'.
