Title: Lab1 - COEN146L
Description: This program quantitatively compares circuit switching and packet switching

!NOTE steps 1.1 - 1.4 are the steps taken before we are requested to rewrite the program with two threads

STEPS(1.1-1.4): Original Code
    step1.1 - created file and copied the code that was given to us into the file
    step1.2 - I compiled the program using "gcc Lab1_s1.c -o Lab1_s1" and no errors or 
            warnings occured. I then made a copy of this file and called it "Lab1_s2"

    step1.3 - I executed "Lab1_s2.c" by running ./Lab1_s2, this caused a segmentation fault
    step1.4 - I executed the program by running "./Lab1_s2 500" and "./Lab1_s2 5000". When I 
            ran "./Lab1_s2 500" the program executed much more quickly than when I ran "./Lab1_s2 5000". 
            This makes sense as the higher the number the higher the delay.
    step1.5 - I went back to the file named "Lab1_s1.c" to implement the changes nessesary to complete
            step number 5

Rewriting the code to use threads instead of processes

STEPS (2.1-2.4): Code w/ Threads
    step2.1 - rewrote the program so that it uses threads instead of processes
    step2.2 - I compiled the program using "gcc Lab1_s1 -o Lab1_s1 -lpthread" and no errors occured.
        However, I did get a warning that states "control reaches end of non-void function",
        but the function its talking about is infact a void function. I do not believe I should be getting
        this error.
    step2.3 - When I executed the program I got a 'segmentation fault' which is the same as before.
    step2.4 - When I excuted "./Lab1_s1 500" and "./Lab1_s1 5000" the same thing occured as before. 
        Executing "./Lab1_s1 500" is faster than executing "./Lab1_s1 5000"
